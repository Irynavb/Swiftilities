# Swiftilities

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

### Adding A New Subspec
1. Create a new directory within the Classes folder (or Assets, if required)
2. Add the new files to the directory created in step 1
3. Add a subspec to the Swiftilities.podspec following this pattern:
    ```ruby
    # <Your Subsepc Name>
    
    s.subspec "<Your Subsepc Name>" do |ss|
    	ss.source_files = "Pod/Classes/<Your Subsepc Name>/*.swift"
    	ss.frameworks   = ["<Any Required Modules>"]
    end 
    ```
4. Apend a `ss.dependency` to `s.subsec` within the podspec file with the following format: 
```ruby
ss.dependency 'Swiftilities/<Your Subsepc Name>'
```
5. Navigate to the example project directory and run `bundle exec pod update`
